intersection
Write a function, intersection, that takes in two arrays, a,b, as arguments. The function should return a new array containing elements that are in both of the two arrays.

You may assume that each input array does not contain duplicate elements.

intersection([4,2,1,6], [3,6,9,2,10]) // -> [2,6]
intersection([2,4,6], [4,2]) // -> [2,4]
