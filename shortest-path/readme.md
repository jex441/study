# shortest path

Write a function, shortestPath, that takes in an array of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (nodeA, nodeB). The function should return the length of the shortest path between A and B. Consider the length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes. If there is no path between A and B, then return -1. You can assume that A and B exist as nodes in the graph.

```
const edges = [
  ['w', 'x'],
  ['x', 'y'],
  ['z', 'y'],
  ['z', 'v'],
  ['w', 'v']
];

shortestPath(edges, 'w', 'z'); // -> 2
```
